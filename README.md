# Event-Tracker-App
Briefly summarize the requirements and goals of the app you developed. What user needs was this app designed to address?
The goal of this event tracker app was to provide users with a platform to organize and have all their events all in one place. The requirements included a login method, a registration method, a page where the user can see their events, add new events, delete events or edit events and a SMS notification system for when an event is occuring soon. 

What screens and features were necessary to support user needs and produce a user-centered UI for the app? How did your UI designs keep users in mind? Why were your designs successful?
The screens and features necessary to support user needs and produce a user-centered UI for the app were a login screen, registration screen, add events screen, edit or delete events screen, view all events screen and an SMS button for the user to approve or deny receiving text message updates on when their event is occuring. The UI design was simple and easy to navigate to ensure the users would have an easy time using the app to accomplish their goals. The design was successful since it accomplished the goal all while providing a simple and easy to navigate platform for event tracking. 

How did you approach the process of coding your app? What techniques or strategies did you use? How could those be applied in the future?
The approach I took when coding the app was first designing the look of the app, then how the code needed to work in a diagram for the UI features to work. Both were used as a roadmap and then I started programming the app page by page. I implemented CRUD functionality for the database, which was used throughout the screens. CRUD (create, read, update, and delete) functionality can be used in the future for many types of programs that use databases. Designing the program and the UI before I started helped the programming section go a lot smoother, which will definitely be applied to future projects. 

How did you test to ensure your code was functional? Why is this process important and what did it reveal?
To test the code, I ran the program after a function was created to see if it worked as it was supposed to. This ensured each section I was adding was functional with the rest of the app. This process is extremely important as not testing can lead to an app or program that does not function as it should or at all.

Considering the full app design and development process, from initial planning to finalization, where did you have to innovate to overcome a challenge?
From the whole process starting with design to development, the backend coding was the most difficult and challenging for me. I designed how the program should function and at times it did not work, which meant I had to do more research on different methods until I found something that worked as it should. 

In what specific component from your mobile app were you particularly successful in demonstrating your knowledge, skills, and experience?
The component I believe was the most successful in demonstrating my knowledge and skills is the login/ registration screens and the corresponding database. Ensuring that the users email and password are valid and all field are filled out when logging in was very successful. The registration screen was successful as it added new users to the database, checked if the user is already registered, if they did not fill out the required fields, and that the password confirmation matched the initial password were all successful components.
